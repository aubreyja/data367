## Essential Stat in Your Sport, Part 1

Find a statistic that best explains scoring (or winning percentage) in the sport of your choosing. If you choose baseball, you must choose a statistic different from any of the stats we worked with previously. For this assignment aim to give:

- details on the statistic
- the model that you get from using regression, including the R-squared and standard error values
- a scatterplot of the data with the regression line included

Write up your solution in this qmd file and your data files to this Github classroom repository. You must write this up in Python, use `pandas` to import the data into a dataframe, and use `statsmodels` to run the regression.
