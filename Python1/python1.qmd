## Essential Stat in Your Sport, Continued...

For the in-class activity on February 2nd, you were asked to find a statistic that best explains scoring (or winning percentage) in the sport of your choosing, and to give:

- details on the statistic
- the model that you get from using regression, including the R-squared and standard error values.
- a scatterplot of the data with the regression line included.

In this assignment, we want you to determine if the statistic you identified/created in part 1 is suitable for prediction.

Write up your findings from the in this qmd file. You should include:

- All of the items above from part 1
- the data file (with a filename path that loads properly)
- details of the statistic/variable you created
- details of the model you created, such as the formula, R2 value and standard error
- all of the assumptions for determining if the statistic is suitable for prediction are explicitly checked and a conclusion on whether the statistic is suitable is made.

Submit this qmd file and your data files to this Github classroom repository. The deadline is Monday February 9th at 11:59pm.
