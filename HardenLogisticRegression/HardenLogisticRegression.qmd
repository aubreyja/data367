## Overview
Having a game-changing player in the NBA can affect how successful his team is throughout the season. James Harden is no exception. While he was with the Rockets, he has made a name for himself through lots and lots of scoring (even if plenty of those points came from the free throw line). With that said, how well does James Harden need to do to ensure that the Rockets get a win? We will use logistic regression to answer this question.

## Logistic Regression Review

Logistic regression uses the machinery of linear regression, but adapts it for binary responses. The main limitation of linear regression is that the responses can be any real number. However, with binary responses, we are often interested in probabilities, which range between 0 and 1. 

The way we adapt linear regression for logistic regression is by applying a _logit_ transform. We model the _log-odds_ with linear regression:
$$
\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta}_1 x.
$$
After some mathematical manipulation, we can rewrite it in terms of probability: 
$$
p = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-\left(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x\right) \right)}
= \frac{\exp\left(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x \right)}{1 + \exp\left(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x \right)}.
$$
